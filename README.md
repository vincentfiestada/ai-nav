This project is my solution to the CS 180 Machine Problem # 1 for AY 2015-2016 Semester 1 at the University of the Philippines Diliman. It's an idealization of an intelligent agent that navigates a simple 200x400 space with polygonal obstacles using any one of the following search algorithms: BFS, DFS, and A* Search.
